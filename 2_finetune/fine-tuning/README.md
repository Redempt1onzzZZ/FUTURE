# Fine-tuning

This directory contains tools for fine-tuning language models on code conversion and generation tasks using the datasets generated in previous steps.

- `finetune_template.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step guide for fine-tuning models on code datasets
- `merge_model.py`: Script for merging fine-tuned models with the base model

After fine-tuning, you can merge the fine-tuned model with the base model or perform adapter merging using `merge_model.py`
